Moving House
â€‹You are moving house, and your parents won't let you take your toys with you. Fortunately, there is a donation station for a local charity right in your front yard! Gather your toys and donate them, but be careful, your parents are very impatient and waiting in the car. Everything needs to be locked when you leave, so you'll gave to carry a key around you at all times.
